# You AutoComplete Me

This app was built in my second quarter at Turing School of Software and Design. It was an assignment designed to acquaint the students with prefix tries.

I created a(n unrequired) front end in 3 hours using vanilla JavaScript, and imported a custom dictionary of adjectives.

To use:
* [Visit the live page here](https://letakeane.github.io/CompleteMe/)
 _or_
* Clone this repo
* Run ```$ npm install```
* Open ```index.html```
* Create weird acrostic poems for all your loved ones or enemies!
